# RAG_SPM - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Phishing and Scam Message Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for analyzing phishing and scam messages. It uses natural language processing techniques to identify and explain suspicious communications.

## Features

- Retrieves relevant passages from a knowledge base to generate responses
- Utilizes Word2Vec for text vectorization
- Integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model for natural language generation
- Analyzes phishing and scam messages along with their explanations

## Setup

To run this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
3. Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

## Usage

The main functionality of this project includes:

1. Preprocessing text data using WordNet lemmatization and stopword removal
2. Vectorizing text using Word2Vec
3. Creating a knowledge base for RAG
4. Generating responses based on queries

To run the full analysis pipeline:
